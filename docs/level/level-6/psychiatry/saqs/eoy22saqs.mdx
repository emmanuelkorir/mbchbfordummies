Question 2

A 23-year-old young man admitted at hospital with head injury and fractured arm is becoming increasingly restless and aggressive.

a. State what measures you would take to ensure your own safety while interviewing him. (20marks)

<details>
I would modify my environment in the following ways:
- Keep an adequate distance from the patient
- Arrange the furniture in a way that I have a clear route of exit from the room
- I would keep the door open always
- Remove possible materials that the patient might use as missiles to throw at me

Approach to patient
- I would approach the patient calmly, introduce myself and greet the patient respectfully
- I would reassure patient on his safety and that it will be okay
- I would maintain appropriate eye contact with the patient but not too prolonged that it incites him
- I would ask for a an extra person in the room to help ensure my safety and for reinforcement
- I would advocate for the use of physical restraints if the patient is too aggressive and threatening
Pharmacological:
- Analgesia for the fractured arm
- Splint the arm , this will reduce the pain and prevent further deformity
- Sedate the patient using a Benzodiazepine such as Midazolam, or Antipsychotics such as Haloperidol, Olanzapine or Risperidone

Last resort
- If all this doesn't help, I could ask another individual to interview the patient, or even terminate the interview so i can do it when the patient is calm.

Answer 2:

they dont have any weapons, have doors that cant be locked from inside, sit close to exit, have someone present, stay calm, maintain a distance, have security, avoid a judgemental tone, reassure them, avoid having things in the office that they may use as potential weapons, avoid using an accusatory tone, address their concerns, active listening, remove potential triggers, have chemical and physical restraints e.g. sedation, constant supervision, avoid false promises, train in self defense, create a good rapport, tuck away personal belongings, keep door open, avoid confrontation, give clear and concise responses, dont allow yourself to be cornered by the patient, wear comfortable shoes to be ready to run (not heels)

At the time you see him, he has already been treated with sertraline for 6 weeks, at a dose of 50-100mg/day, with no improvement.

Question 4

We generally associate cognitive deficits occurring in clear consciousness with dementia. However, many elderly patients with psychiatric disorders, in particular depression, also present with cognitive complaints and a syndrome that resembles dementia.

a. What are the main features that help distinguish the cognitive syndrome of depression from that of dementia? (8 marks)

<details>
Dementia
- Onset is months to years

- Course is chronic with deterioration over time
- Patient is likely to hide or be unaware of cognitive deficits
- Activities of daily living may be intact early, impaired as disease progresses
Depression
- onset is weeks to months
- mood is low/apathetic
- course is chronic; responds to treatment
- Patient is likely to be concerned about memory impairment
- Activities of daily living may be neglected early, but improve with treatment

2. screen for secondary causes
3. reassess
4. long term monitoring
