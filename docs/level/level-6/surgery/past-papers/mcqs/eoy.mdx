### Question 1

A 42-year-old woman has a mass in the posterior aspect of the upper part of her arm that was first noted 3 months earlier.It is not painful and she has no associated symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates a 5-cm neoplasm arising from the triceps.
The best next step in the management of this patient is:

a. Percutaneous core needle biopsy

b.Excisional biopsy

c.Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy

d.PET-computed tomography (CT)

e. Incisional biopsy

<details>
a. Percutaneous core needle biopsy
</details>

### Question 2

A 27-year-old man is suspected of having acute appendicitis. On physical examination his abdomen is soft and nondistended. He does not have pain with coughing or reproduction of tenderness in the right lower quadrant when palpated in the left lower quadrant. He experiences abdominal pain during extension of the right thigh while lying on his left side. He does not have pain with passive rotation of his right hip in a flexed position. Where do you suspect the location of the tip of his appendix to be?

a. Extraperitoneal and lying anterior to the cecum

b. Displaced ot the right upper quadrant

c. In the pelvis

d. Retrocecal over the psoas muscle

e In the left lower quadrant 

<details>
d. Retrocecal over the psoas muscle



Pelvic is more common in children. Obturator and psoas signs are positive. Tenderness on DRE. Early diarrhea results from an inflamed appendix being in contact with the rectum. An inflamed appendix in contact with the bladder may cause frequency of micturition. 

Postileal - . It presents the greatest difficulty in diagnosis because the pain may not shift, diarrhea is a feature and marked retching may occur. Tenderness, if any, is ill defined, although it may be present immediately to the right of the umbilicus. 

</details>

### Question 3

A 27-year-old man has a 1-day history of right lower quadrant pain and leukocytosis. Probable non perforated acute appendicitis is diagnosed. What is the best antibiotic and surgical management for this patient?

a. Administer cefazolin perioperatively to reduce the risk for wound infection and then operate.

b. Begin the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics perioperatively such as ceftriaxone and Flagyl and proceed with appendectomy.

c. Begin ceftriaxone and metronidazole (Flagyl) and monitor the patient with serial abdominal examinations, with surgery being reserved in the event that he fails to improve.

d. Operate and then await the results of culture of peritoneal fluid obtained during the surgery and tailor the selection of antibiotics accordingly.

e. Begin clindamycin perioperatively, because Bacteroides fragilis is the most common organism involved in acute appendicitis.

<details>
c. Begin ceftriaxone and metronidazole (Flagyl) and monitor the patient with serial abdominal examinations, with surgery being reserved in the event that he fails to improve.
</details>

### Question 4

a. Functional residual capacity

b. Cardiac output

c. Arterial pressure

### Question 5

A 53-year-old woman is now postoperative day 10 following a whipple procedure for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and she develops a petechial rash. Routine laboratory evaluation is significant for an acute decrease in her platelet count from 150,000/pL to 40,000/uL. She receives a diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Which of the following is the appropriate management of this condition?

a.Convert the patient from unfractionated heparin to low- molecular-weight heparin.

b.Give a platelet transfusion to a goal of more than 50,000/uL.

c.Discontinue unfractionated heparin and begin a direct thrombin inhibitor.

d.Discontinue unfractionated heparin as the patient no longer requires anticoagulation.

e.Continue unfractionated heparin and add a second agent, either a vitamin K antagonist or a direct thrombin inhibitor

<details>
c.Discontinue unfractionated heparin and begin a direct thrombin inhibitor.

HIT results from an autoantibody directed against platelet factor 4 (PF4) in complex with heparin (referred to as a HIT antibody). HIT antibodies activate platelets and can cause catastrophic arterial and venous thrombosis, with a mortality rate as high as 20 percent, although with improved recognition and early intervention. 

HIT can be caused by both UFH and LMWH

### Question 20

Following an acute spinal cord injury, a patient presents with systemic hypotension and relative bradycardia. His bulbocavernosus reflex is present. This is characteristic of what type of response in acute spinal cord injuries?

a.Septic shock

b.Hypovolemic shock

c.Neurogenic shock

d.Spinal shock 

<details>
c.Neurogenic shock

Neurogenic shock presents with hypotension, a normal heart rate or bradycardia and warm peripheries.

### Question  23

A 55-year-old female patient comes to your clinic with a complaint of shoulder pain that has been present for several weeks.

Transient synovitis occurs following URTI, bacterial or viral infections, common at 4-9 years of age, in boys and present with hip joint pain that radiates to the knees. Use modified kocher criteria to r/o septic arthritis

</details>

### Question 31

### Question 32

A 35-year-old woman presents with a right breast mass. You perform a
thorough history and physical examination as well as a core biopsy of the right breast mass. In which of the following circumstances would a sentinel lymph node biopsy be indicated?

a.The core biopsy is consistent with ductal carcinoma in situ without comedo necrosis for which the patient desires partial mastectomy only.

b.The core biopsy is consistent with ductal carcinoma and the patient has palpable axillary lymph nodes.

c.The core biopsy is consistent with ductal carcinoma and the patient desires partial mastectomy.

e.The core biopsy is consistent with ductal carcinoma and the patient has a bone scan suspicious for metastasis.

<details>
c.The core biopsy is consistent with ductal carcinoma and the patient desires partial mastectomy.

In breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy is not recommended in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) not undergoing mastectomy. Patients with extensive DCIS requiring mastectomy may benefit from a sentinel lymph node biopsy in the event that there was an occult carcinoma present in the specimen, since sentinel lymph node biopsy cannot be performed after a mastectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is also not indicated in patients who are pregnant or who have had prior surgery either in the axilla or in the breast (unrelated to cancer).
