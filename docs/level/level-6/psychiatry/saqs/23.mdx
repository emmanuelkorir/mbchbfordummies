### Question 2

DSM V: Briefly describe the difference between distinguishes paraphillias from Paraphillic disorders under the DSM V:(10 marks)

<details>
Paraphilia - any intense and persistent sexual interest other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human partners. any sexual interest greater than or equal to normophilic sexual interests.

Paraphilic disorder - a paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, to others. A paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic dis-order, and a paraphilia by itself does not necessarily justify or require clinical intervention.

Chat GPT:

##### Paraphilias
1. **Definition**: Paraphilias are atypical sexual interests or behaviors.
2. **Focus**: Involves intense and persistent sexual interests other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human partners.
3. **Clinical Concern**: Paraphilias by themselves do not necessarily cause harm or distress to the individual or others.
4. **DSM-5 Classification**: Paraphilias are not classified as mental disorders unless they cause significant distress or impairment to the individual or harm to others.

##### Paraphilic Disorders
1. **Definition**: Paraphilic disorders are paraphilias that cause distress or impairment to the individual or entail personal harm or risk of harm to others.
2. **Focus**: Involves intense and persistent sexual interests that lead to significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, or entail harm or risk of harm to others.
3. **Clinical Concern**: The key distinguishing factor is the presence of distress, impairment, or harm. 
4. **DSM-5 Classification**: Paraphilic disorders are considered mental disorders and are diagnosed when the paraphilia results in significant distress, impairment, or involves non-consenting individuals.

A 17 year old boy called me after getting my number from the internet. He just said- "I am Maina, I steal women's underwear, I put them on for sexual satisfaction. One day I almost got beaten by a mob when I was caught stealing from a washing line".

i) Just based on this information, where would you categorize Maina and why? [5 Marks]

<details>
Paraphilic disorder - a paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, to others. Almost beaten by a mob

Chat GPT:
- Maina exhibits an atypical sexual interest, specifically deriving sexual satisfaction from stealing and wearing women's underwear. This behavior is indicative of a paraphilia.
- Risk of Harm: Maina's behavior has led to a situation where he was almost beaten by a mob, indicating that his actions pose a risk of harm, both to himself (physical danger) and potentially to others (invasion of privacy and theft).
- Distress and Impairment: The distress or impairment criteria for paraphilic disorders can be inferred from Maina reaching out for help. His behavior has led to significant negative consequences, suggesting it may cause distress or impair his social or occupational functioning.
- Criminal Aspect: The act of stealing women's underwear also has a criminal element, which can exacerbate the distress and impairment associated with his paraphilia.
</details>

ii) Can you specify the type of sexual behavior? [5 Marks]

<details>
Transvestic disorder - recurrent and intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors over a period of 6 months.

Chat GPT:
- Transverstic Disorder: Maina's behavior of stealing and wearing women's garments

Recurrent and Intense Sexual Arousal: Maina experiences sexual arousal from wearing and stealing women's underwear. This pattern is persistent and recurrent.

Involves Non-Living Objects: The specific fetish involves non-living objects (women’s underwear).

Significant Distress or Impairment: Maina’s behavior has led to a situation where he was almost beaten by a mob, indicating distress and potential impairment. His actions are also illegal, which can further affect his functioning and well-being.

Not Exclusively During Paraphilic Disorder: The behavior occurs outside of other paraphilic disorders or general sexual dysfunctions.

Duration: The behavior has likely been persistent over time, given that it has led to severe consequences.

### Question 3

Differentiate between Obsessions and compulsions (10 marks)

<details>
Obsessions:
- Recurrent, intrusive & distressing thoughts, images, or impulses
- Leads to compulsions
- Increases a person's anxiety
- Irrational and absurd

Compulsions:
- Repetitive, seemingly purposeful behaviors that a person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession
- Usually follow obsessions
- Decreases a person's anxiety
- Behavior is not connected in a realistic way with what it is designed to neutralize or prevent
- Compulsions that are performed are not pleasurable! Rather, they allow the individual to experience relief from their anxiety or distress

Chat GPT:

### Obsessions vs. Compulsions:

**Obsessions:**

1. **Definition**: Obsessions are persistent, intrusive, and unwanted thoughts, images, or urges that cause significant anxiety or distress.
   
2. **Nature**: They are involuntary and often distressing. Individuals feel that these thoughts are uncontrollable and disturbing.

3. **Example**: A person might have a recurrent, intrusive fear of harming someone they care about, despite knowing they would never act on it.

4. **Impact**: The individual is aware that these thoughts are irrational or excessive but finds them difficult to ignore or dismiss.

5. **Purpose**: Obsessions are not performed to reduce anxiety but are experienced as distressing and bothersome.

**Compulsions:**

1. **Definition**: Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules, aimed at reducing anxiety or preventing a feared event.

2. **Nature**: They are intentional and are done to alleviate the distress caused by obsessions or to prevent a feared outcome.

3. **Example**: A person may wash their hands repeatedly to alleviate the anxiety caused by an obsession with germs or contamination.

4. **Impact**: Compulsions are typically performed to prevent a feared event or to make the obsession feel less distressing. They may become time-consuming and interfere with daily functioning.

5. **Purpose**: Compulsions are intended to reduce the anxiety or prevent the perceived danger or negative outcome associated with the obsession, though they may not be realistically connected to the feared event.

### Key Differences:

- **Origin**: Obsessions are intrusive thoughts or urges that cause distress; compulsions are actions or mental rituals performed to counteract or prevent the distress caused by obsessions.
- **Experience**: Obsessions are experienced as unwanted and distressing thoughts; compulsions are behaviors or actions that the person feels driven to perform.
- **Function**: The function of compulsions is to reduce the anxiety caused by obsessions or to prevent a feared event, while obsessions themselves are sources of anxiety.
- **Control**: Individuals with obsessions recognize the irrationality of their thoughts but cannot control them easily; those with compulsions may feel driven to perform rituals to alleviate distress.
