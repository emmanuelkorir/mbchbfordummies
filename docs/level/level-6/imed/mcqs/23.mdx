### Question 3

A 38-year-old male with HIV is diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis after presenting with fever, headache, confusion, and photophobia. A lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 38 cm H20 and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated positive cryptococcal antigen. In addition to starting appropriate antifungal therapy, what is the OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT of the increased intracranial pressure


a. Administer dexamethasone 4mg IV every 8 hours for 6 weeks

b. Administer acetazolamide 500 mg IV and repeat in 12 hours if needed

c. Perform daily lumbar punctures with removal of cerebrospinal fluid

d. Administer methylprednisolone 4 mg PO every 6 hours for 3 day

<details>

c. Perform daily lumbar punctures with removal of cerebrospinal fluid

If an elevated opening pressure is observed during the initial lumbar puncture, or if signs or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure are observed, the recommended approach is to remove enough cerebrospinal fluid (typically 20 to 30 mL) to reduce the opening pressure by approximately half, with lumbar punctures repeated daily until neurologic signs and symptoms consistently improve. In addition, some experts also recommend repeating daily lumbar punctures until the opening pressure is less than 20 cm H2O. If serial lumbar punctures are not adequate to control intracranial pressures, a lumbar drain or ventriculostomy may be required
