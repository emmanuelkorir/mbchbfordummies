### DAY 1 - FRIDAY

Full hemogram with pancytopenia - most likely diagnosis, 2 invx and findings, principles of mnx

<details>
- bone marrow failure 2 to: drugs (mtx, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, bleomycin), infections(viral-EBV, CMV, HIV protozoal-leishmania, bacteria-TB), malignancies - leukemias, mds, lymphomas, mpo (1 myelofibrosis), multiple myeloma, mets breast, prostate 

investigations:
- peripheral blood film - decreased RBC, WBC, platelets. Vit B12 def - macrocytosis, hypersegmented neutrophils
- bone marrow aspirate/trephine biopsy - hypocellular BMA.

principles of managements:

supportive:
- resuscitation - ABCDE. 
- transfusion: PRBC/whole blood if Hb less than 7 g/dL, platelets if less than 50K, wbcs if neutrophils are less than 0.5
- nutrition: hematinics, folic acid, vit B12, iron
- medications: abx if severe neutropenia, GM-CSF, G-CSF, EPO


definitive:
- treat underlying cause
- if drugs, stop offending drug
- if infection, treat infection. HIV - HAART, anti-TB drugs, leishmania - amphotericin B, sodium stibogluconate, CMV - ganciclovir, foscarnet
- if malignancy, MDT & depends on the staging of the disease. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, BMT

</details>

Abdominal examination - ascites (likely diagnosis, 2 invx, 2 aetiological agents (6D, 7A))

<details>

Investigations:
Laboratory - LFTs, SAAGs, UECs, urinalysis
Imaging - USG

2 aetiological agents:
CVS - Right sided heart failure
GIT - Portal hypertension: alcoholic liver cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, budd-chiari syndrome, schistosomiasis, wilsons, hemochromatosis
Renal - nephrotic syndrome
</details>

Viva - hyperkalemia (ecg interpretation, causes, tx), acute pancreatitis (elevated amylase, causes, tx)

<details>

Hyperkalemia:
- prolonged PR interval
- widened QRS complex
- peaked T waves

causes:
- drugs: K+ sparing diuretics(spironolactone, eplerenone), ACEis, ARBs, succinylcholine
- tumor lysis syndrome
- rhabdomyolysis
- CKD
- metabolic acidosis
- increase intake of KCL
- addison's disease

tx:
- calcium gluconate 10mls 10% IV over 10 mins - stabilize the cardiac membrane
- intracellular shifting: insulin, beta agonists (salbutamol), bicarbonate
- excretion: loop diuretics
- binders: calcium resonium, kayexalate
- hemodiaylsis

“C BIG K DI” (i.e. if you see a big K, the patient could die!)

Causes for acute pancreatitis: 

- I-Idiopathic 
- G-Gallstones (second most common)
- E-Ethanol (most common)
- T-Trauma
- S-Steroids
- M-Mumps
- A-Autoimmune
- S-Scorpion sting
- H-Hyperlipidemia/Hypercalcemia
- E-ERCP
- D-Drugs eg HCTZ, didanosine, azathioprine

Tx: 
Supportive:
- Airway
- Breathing - oxygen supplementation via NRM if SpO2 below 90%
- Circulation - IV fluids (crystalloids) to maintain urine output at 0.5ml/kg/hr for 24-48 hours
- Disability - Pain control. Opioids are safe and effective at providing pain control in patients with acute pancreatitis.  Hydromorphone or fentanyl (intravenous) may be used for pain relief in acute pancreatitis. Meperidine has been favored over morphine for analgesia in pancreatitis because studies showed that morphine caused an increase in sphincter of Oddi pressure. 
- Monitoring of vitals closely for 24-48 hours. Urine output should be measured hourly and fluids should be titrated to maintain urine output (more than 0.5 to 1 mls/kg/hour). Electrolyte should be monitored for 48 to 72 hours, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia should be corrected.
- Nutritional support - Mild pancreatitis can often be managed with intravenous hydration alone since recovery occurs rapidly, allowing patients to resume an oral diet within a week. Nasojejunal feeding for severe pancreatitis if unlikely to resume feeding over 5-7 days. Prefered over TPN. 
- Antibiotics - not routinely recommended. Only used in suspected infected pancreactic necrosis.

Definitive:
- Treat the underlying cause
Non-operative:
- Withdraw or change the offending drug
Operative:
- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
- ERCP - gallstones pancreatitis.cholecystectomy should be performed after recovery for patients with gallstones pancreatitis.
- Pancreatectomy
- Treat hypercalcemia and hypertriglyceridemia
