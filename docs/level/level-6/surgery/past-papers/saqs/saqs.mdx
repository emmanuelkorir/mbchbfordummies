systemic 

</details>

b. principles of management:

<details>
A: Airway stabilization. Inhalation burn injury - endotracheal intubation/tracheostomy. C-spine stabilization if cervical injury suspected.

B: Breathing - high flow oxygen(NRM), hyperbaric oxygen therapy (Carbon monoxide poisoning)

C: Circulation - 2 wide bore cannulas. Parklands formula (4ml/kg/%TBSA, 3.5ml/kg/%TBSA) 1/2 of fluid in first 8h, remaining in next 16h. Ringer's lactate
- monitor bp, hr, urine output
- blood for CBC, GXM, ABG, UEC, COHb
- Maintenance fluids 100mls - first 10kgs, 50mls - 10ks, 20mls/kg

D: GCS
- Analgesia - opioid(morphine)

E: remove all clothes, jewelery, log roll
- hypothermia - keep warm.
- hyperthermia - cool water

Decompression:
- escharotomy, fasciotomy

Medications
- Tetanus toxoid, vitamin c, zinc supplementation
- PPIs
- hematinics

Nutrition
- enteral feeding: day 2 post-admission
- high protein diet
- TPN 

Wound care
- clean with chlorhexiding
- shave hairy areas
- deroof or leave blisters
- dressing: bactigras, hydrocolloids, petroleum gauze, silver sulfadiazine

Rehabilitation
- superficial burns - topical emollients
- physiotherapy, occupational therapy

</details>

c. complications:
