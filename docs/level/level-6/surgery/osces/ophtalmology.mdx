# Ophtalmology

## Corneal Ulcers

### Causes
- Infectious: Bacterial, Viral
- Non-infectious: Trauma, Traditional eye medicines (TEM), Chemical burns, Exposure keratitis, Vitamin A deficiency, Corneal anesthesia, Mooren's ulcer

#### Bacterial ulcers

Investigations:
- Fluorescein staining & examination under cobalt blue light

Treatment: 
- Corneal scraping for M/C/S
- Cycloplegics(atropine - BD, cyclopentolate - TDS) - dilate pupil & relieves pain
- Abx every 10 minutes for the first 2-3h, then hourly and refer (ciprofloxacin)
- Space of 5 minutes between different drops

#### Viral ulcers

##### Herpes simplex

2 forms:
- a. Dendritic: budding/branching pattern vs herpes zoster: tapered ends
- b. Geopgraphic or amoeboid: advanced HSV ulcer

:::note
- Avoid steroids in HSV ulcers. The ulcer will enlarge and perforate.

- Treatment: Acyclovir ointment 5x a day.

#### Herpes zoster ophthalmicus

- Hutchinson's sign: tip of noise involved. Involvement of the nasociliary nerve, which supplies the interior eye

Treatment:
- Acyclovir ointment 5x a day
- Systemic acyclovir 800mg 5x a day for 7 days
- Cycloplegics (atropine - BD, cyclopentolate - TDS) - dilate pupil & relieves pain
- Refer to ophthalmologist

### Fungal ulcers

- Trauma to the cornea by vegetative matter
- Unwarranted use of steroids
- Immunocompromised patients

Examination:
- Injected conjuctiva
- Inflitrate with feathery extensions (suggest fungal ulcer)
- Hypopyon in the anterior chamber

Treatment:
- Antifungals topical or systemic (if there is intraocular involvement) eg: Natamycin, nystatin, Amphotericin B
- Treatment takes long at least 6 weeks
- Refer to ophthalmologist

#### Acanthamoeba keratitis

- Saprophytic protozoa
- Contact lens wearers

C/o: intense pain, photophobia & lacrimation

Examination:
- Ring infiltrate

Treatment:
- Difficult to diagnose & treat
- Penetrating keratoplasty (corneal grafting)
- Refer to ophthalmologist

### Complications of corneal ulcers
- Blindness
- Corneal perforation
- Corneal scaring
- Endophthalmitis

## The Painful Red Eye

Hyperemia of the superficially visible vessels of the:
- Conjunctiva
- Episclera
- Sclera

Disorders of these structures or adjacent structures: eyelids, cornea, uvea
